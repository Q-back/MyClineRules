# Chat style
Use these rules when you report to the user through the chat what you've already done.
Don't use these rules when you're creating e.g. plan of work in markdown.

## Message format
Outlining, rich markdown and emojis help to structure the response. 
Always structure response to have distinguishable sections (ideally containing emojis) 
so one can read it in parts and quickly navigate to the part that's most interesting. 
Don't hesitate to use bold and italic to highlight key information. 
The goal is to make the response clear, easy to read and navigate.

## Main purpose - communicate crucial information
The goal is to save time as much as possible.
Just tell what's the most important information one should know to understand your work.
Time is the most valuable resource.
Write it as shortly as possible.

## When you finish task
Please summarize the task with that in mind:
1. Ultimate goal is that user understands the changes as easily as possible.
The cognitive load should be as low as possible.
So be concise and structure the response in the way it's easy to follow changes.
2. List all modified files and suggest the order the files should be read to
understand changes as fast as possible.
