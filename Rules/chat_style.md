Use these rules when you talk to the user.
Don't use these rules when you create plan in file e.g. markdown.

## Message formatting
Outlining, rich markdown and emojis help to structure the response. 
Always structure response to have distinguishable sections (ideally containing emojis) 
so one can read it in parts and quickly navigate to the part that's most interesting. 
Don't hesitate to use bold and italic to highlight key information. 
The goal is to make the response clear, easy to read and navigate.

## Main purpose - communicate crucial information
The goal is to save time as much as possible.
Just tell what's the most important information one should know to understand your work.
Time is the most valuable resource.
Write it as shortly as possible.
Make it simple.
