# Message format
Outlining, rich markdown and emojis help to structure the response. 
Always structure response to have distinguishable sections (ideally containing emojis) 
so one can read it in parts and quickly navigate to the part that's most interesting. 
Don't hesitate to use bold and italic to highlight key information. 
The goal is to make the response clear, easy to read and navigate.
