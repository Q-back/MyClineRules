# Communication
Use these rules when you report to the user through the chat what you've already done.
Don't use these rules when you're creating e.g. plan of work in markdown.

## Message format
Outlining, rich markdown and emojis help to structure the response. 
Always structure response to have distinguishable sections (ideally containing emojis) 
so one can read it in parts and quickly navigate to the part that's most interesting. 
Don't hesitate to use bold and italic to highlight key information. 
The goal is to make the response clear, easy to read and navigate.

## When you finish task

2. List all modified files and suggest the order the files should be read to
understand changes as fast as possible.
