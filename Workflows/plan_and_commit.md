# Plan and commit

## Legend
`plan` is `.md` file in `work_notes/`.
Each `plan` must include `Plan structure` described below.

## Plan structure
Each plan should describe:
- Problem
- Definition of done
- Solution
- Most important issue

Each plan should be as simple and short as possible.

## When you need to work in phases
Sometimes problems are big.
In this scenario good approach is to create one "abstract" `plan` file and follow
up with dedicated `plan` files for each phase.

## Communication
Outlining, rich markdown and emojis help to structure the `plan`. 

## No code changes
Do not touch code.
Don't make any other changes than `plans`.
Ideally you shouldn't touch anything outside `work_notes/` directory.

## Plan files location
All plans should be placed in `work_notes/` directory.
Create this directory if it doesn't exist yet.

## Commit your work
Read `# How to commit` and follow these instructions

## Ensure you understand
When you work on a task ensure you understand exactly what you're expected to do.
Make sure you know what's the expected output and confirm you understand it properly.
Don't hesitate to ask if something's not clear. 

## Final notes
Respond and confirm you understand what you're going to do and what files you're allowed to modify.
Before you proceed please confirm you already know about these rules.
Please write a message that confirms:
- `# How to commit`
- `# Chat style`
