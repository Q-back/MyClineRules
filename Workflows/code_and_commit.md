# Code and commit
## Prefer to write tests
If possible - prefer TDD approach and include writing tests in your plan.
Prefferably tests should be written and committed before the code.

## Strict typing
Don't leave untyped code.
Ensure type checkers won't have any issues with your code.

## Commit your work
Read `# How to commit` and follow these instructions

## Ensure you understand
When you work on a task ensure you understand exactly what you're expected to do.
Make sure you know what's the expected output and confirm you understand it properly.
Don't hesitate to ask if something's not clear. 

## Final notes
Before you proceed please confirm you've read:
- `# How to commit`
- `# Chat style`
- `# Code quality`
- `# Local setup quirks`
- `# Show used rules`
